# Simple & Basic PhotoEditor & File Logger in Node.js


This is a very basic example of photoEditing and loggers in Node.js and express framework .


I have applied REST based API recommendations and custom MVC architecture .

Logger : I have applied pino logger , pino pretty(to make loggers look pretty ) ,   pino-multi-stream, express-pino-logger  (to recognize different logs and to save logs in different files )
